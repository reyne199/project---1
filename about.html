                        The body forms of nudibranchs vary greatly. Because they are opisthobranchs, unlike most other gastropods, they are apparently bilaterally symmetrical externally (but not internally) because they have undergone secondary detorsion.<br><br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;

                    In all nudibranchs, the male and female sexual openings are on the right side of the body, reflecting their asymmetrical origins. They lack a mantle cavity. Some species have venomous appendages (cerata) on their sides, which deter predators. Many also have a simple gut and a mouth with a radula.[14]<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    The eyes in nudibranchs are simple and able to discern little more than light and dark.[15] The eyes are set into the body, are about a quarter of a millimeter in diameter, and consist of a lens and five photoreceptors.[16]<br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    
                    Nudibranchs vary in adult size from 4 to 600 mm (0.16 to 23.62 in).[17]
                    
                    The adult form is without a shell or operculum (in shelled gastropods, the operculum is a bony or horny plate that can cover the opening of the shell when the body is withdrawn). In most species, there is a swimming veliger larva with a coiled shell, but the shell is shed at metamorphosis when the larva transforms into the adult form. Some species have direct development, and the shell is shed before the animal emerges from the egg mass.[14]<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    
                    
                    Nudibranchs have cephalic (head) tentacles, which are sensitive to touch, taste, and smell. Club-shaped rhinophores detect odors.</p>
