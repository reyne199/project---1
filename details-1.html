            <p class="details-p">&nbsp;This nudibranch displays a stunning set of colors: the body is purple, the cerata are orange and the rhinophores are scarlet. The neon orange appendages on the back of Flabellinopsis iodinea are the cerata which extract oxygen from the sea water they are surrounded by and live in. The cerata are also extensions of the digestive system, and are used to store the stinging cells of the anemones and fan-like hydroids they eat. The red rhinophores are sensory structures used for detecting the presence of possible mates and prey. The purple, red, and orange colors are derived from a single carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin. </p>

        <h1 class="details-h1">spanish dancer</h1> 
        <br>
            <p class="details-p">&nbsp;The Spanish dancer is one of the largest species and best swimmers of the nudibranchs. Nudibranchs are mollusks who don't have shells in their adult stage. When the Spanish dancer swims, the wide edges of its mantle (the parapodia) are pushed through the water in a graceful undulating movement reminiscent of flamenco dancers. The Spanish dancer is not just known for its dance. It has a reproductive strategy of covering its egg cluster, also called a sea rose, with toxins taken from their venomous food sources in order to protect the eggs from predators</p>
